I produced this design using the pointillism technique. When it comes to points, I experimented with different points sizes and values.I based my design on animal cruelty at circuses; in fact, I created a tiger on a circus ball, along with puppet strings that surround its hands and feet. I also included a showman's hat and wand in the background to give it a circus aspect. To show the theme more effectively, I used colours that can be found at the circus. I chose the tiger as the focal point of the design to draw attention to it because it is a wild animal and the circus is not its natural environment. The strings are used to demonstrate how animals are treated in circuses only for the purpose of entertainment and profit. When you look at this design, it makes you feel emotional.</div>
